# 🎮 Amazon Q Tetris

This project is a modern recreation of the classic **Tetris** game, built entirely using **Amazon Q Developer CLI** prompts. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how conversational AI can be used to scaffold, generate, and debug real-world applications — in this case, a browser-based puzzle game.

- ⌨️ Keyboard controls for movement, drop, and rotation
- 🧠 Auto line-clearing and scoring system
- 💡 Clean, responsive UI with CSS styling
- ⚙️ Developed with AI-driven prompts using Amazon Q Developer CLI

## 🧠 Built With Prompts Like:
```
- "Create a canvas-based Tetris grid with falling pieces."
- "Add collision detection and line-clearing logic."
- "Score 100 points per cleared line."
- "Rotate tetromino using matrix transpose."

All core logic and rendering code was generated and iteratively refined using Amazon Q Developer CLI.
